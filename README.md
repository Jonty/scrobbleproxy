Scrobbleproxy
-------------

A terrible Last.fm API 2.0 compatible server, implementing scrobbling and authentication. Currently using mocked out local storage in sqlite.

You'll want this in your hosts file for now:
````
127.0.0.1 ws.audioscrobbler.com
127.0.0.1 www.last.fm
````

You do not want to use this yet. Here be dragons.

DRAGONS I SAID.
